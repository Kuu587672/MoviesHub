## Version-0

1. Just started a react project named "disney-clone".
2. Created the header section, which contains the logo, navigation(icons used from react-icons), and a dummy profile picture.
3. The navigation tabs when hovered turns grey and also an underline appears from left to right in a smooth manner.

## Version-0.1

1. Added full responsive behavior to the Header component.
2. On medium screens (md:) only 3 primary icons are displayed for a cleaner layout.
3. Implemented a 3-dots toggle button (HiDotsVertical) that reveals the remaining menu items.
4. Toggle menu now supports:</br>
&emsp;1. Smooth appearance/disappearance</br>
&emsp;2. Intuitive mobile/tablet navigation</br>
&emsp;3. Consistent icon + text styling
